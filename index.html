<h1 style="font-weight:bolder; color: white;">Energy and Environment in Harmony</h1>
<p style="color:white;">The petroleum industry, also known as the oil industry or the oil patch, includes the global processes of exploration, extraction, refining, transportation 
    (often by oil tankers and pipelines), and marketing of petroleum products. 
    The largest volume products of the industry are fuel oil and gasoline (petrol). 
    The oil and gas industry supports millions of American jobs, provides lower energy costs for consumers,
     and ensures our energy security.
     With rising global demand, highly volatile prices and increasingly stringent environmental
      regulations, the oil and gas industry faces three major challenges : reduce costs, optimize the performance of its industrial base assets and improve its environmental footprint.</p>
